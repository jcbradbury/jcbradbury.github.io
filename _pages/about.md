I am a professor of economics at Kennesaw State University in metro-Atlanta, where I teach courses on microeconomics. 

I am an applied economist who works primarily in the fields of public economics and sports economics, and I have a strong interest in public policy. My recent research has focused on local economic development policy, particularly public financing of sports venues and film production incentives. I served on the Board of Directors for the Development Authority of Cobb County from 2019 to 2023. I am currently an associate editor for *Journal of Sports Economics*.

I live in Marietta, Georgia with my wife, and we have two adult daughters and one dog. I'm an avid sports fan who follows baseball (Atlanta Braves), football (Carolina Panthers and Georgia Bulldogs/Wofford Terriers), and soccer (Atlanta United). In my spare time, I homebrew beer and play guitar, but I'm not particularly good at either of them.

I am active on social media. You can follow me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/jcbradbury.com) and [Twitter](https://x.com/jc_bradbury).
